			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Graduate in Economics by University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria with a special interest in data analysis, definition of strategies and policy making. Born and raised in Canary Islands (Spain), currently living in London (United Kingdom) and enrolled in the MSc in Data Science at the London School of Economics and Political Science. I consider myself an open-minded communicator who finds a self-fulfilling process in cultural exchange and travelling. Always willing to face new challenges, I have had the opportunity to work as a trainee in both public and private environments, from enterprises like Enel and Hyundai to the European Parliament. I would like to keep my focus on the quality of the results of every task faced in this new period of my professional life, in which I would like to accomplish an advanced level of programming and analytical skills in order to face the technological challenges of this era.</p>
